This bot, [@course_remix](https://twitter.com/course_remix), takes the titles of the courses I'm currently enrolled in this semester and remixes them, switching the different separate words included in the title for synonyms I've found on Thesaurus. Although some of the words I found I wouldn't really consider synonyms, I left them there anyways for as I found the random results amusing. The bot also randomly rearranges what days of the week I take what class.
