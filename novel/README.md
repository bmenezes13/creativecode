# NaNoGenMo: Berg Of Spiel
Being a fan of Steven Spielberg, I chose to use his material as input for this project. I used the Markov python library to take in five different screenplays from Spielberg's movies in an attempt to create the oddest crossover event possible. Using the code from the Revolution_recipes project as reference, I was able to save the output novel to a pdf file titled "BoS.pdf".
