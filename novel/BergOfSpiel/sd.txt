A simple GAME SHOW SET -- one long desk-that houses four
"CELEBRITY PANELISTS," a small pulpit with attached microphone
          for the host, BUD COLLYER, who walks through the curtain to
          the delight of the audience. Bud bows and waves to the
          celebrities -- ORSON BEAN, KITTY CARLISLE, TOM POSTON, and
          PEGGY CASS.
