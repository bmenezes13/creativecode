# BlackCatPoem

Using the example franken script as a basis, this program parses into a file titled "blackcat.txt", referring to The Black Cat short story, written by Edgar Allan Poe. After experimenting with different word type variations and patterns, I found a flow that I liked, resulting in poems made up each of four couplets.
I have to admit using this story was... interesting to say the least. One could expect that making poetry out of a rather dark story will result in some rather dark results. 

Ex1.:
"the pestilence in frequent
have than terrible

the reason as strange
get about fourth

a corpse with human
have than rough

a spirit of odious
make that such"

In this sample output, I could interpret the result as a poetry surrounding a question about death, and perhaps the meaning behind it.

Ex2.:
"the wretchedness of former
make than new

The course by expect
confess of noose

The dog with large
get without uncomplaining

the sobbing on continuous
remove by radical"

In this other poem my program spat out, I can sense a theme about some strong reform in order.
