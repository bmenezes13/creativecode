# Sine Spheres

This project is a "screensaver" designed for the media wall in the HCC. The main focal point of the image is a cluster of spheres moving based on the translation of sine values depending on the frameCount. This whole cluster is colored using lighting effects and is encapsulated by two larger spheres, one yellow and one purple. 

I have my source code [here](spheresofSine.js), and you can see the image being presented [here](https://editor.p5js.org/bmenezes13/present/c0EIUE8AA).
